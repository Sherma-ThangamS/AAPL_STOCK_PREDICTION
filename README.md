# Linear-Regression
Linear Regression Prediction of Stock Prices


This is a machine learning project that uses linear regression to predict stock prices based on historical data.

Overview


This project uses Python and popular machine learning libraries such as numpy and pandas to build a linear regression model that predicts stock prices. The dataset used in this project contains historical data of a company's stock prices, including the date, opening price, highest price, lowest price, closing price and volume of shares traded.

The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering and model training. The trained model is then used to make predictions on the stock prices for future dates.

Installation
